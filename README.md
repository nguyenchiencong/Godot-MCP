# Godot MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A comprehensive integration between Godot Engine and AI assistants using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This plugin allows AI assistants to interact with your Godot projects, providing powerful capabilities for code assistance, scene manipulation, and project management.

## Features

- **Full Godot Project Access**: AI assistants can access and modify scripts, scenes, nodes, and project resources
- **Two-way Communication**: Send project data to AI and apply suggested changes directly in the editor
- **Command Categories**:
  - **Node Commands**: Create, modify, and manage nodes in your scenes
  - **Script Commands**: Edit, analyze, and create GDScript files
  - **Scene Commands**: Manipulate scenes and their structure
  - **Project Commands**: Access project settings and resources
  - **Editor Commands**: Control various editor functionality
  - **Enhanced Commands**: Access full scene tree, debug output, and asset management

## Enhanced Features (New)

This fork adds several significant improvements:

- **Complete Scene Tree Visibility**: Retrieve the entire scene hierarchy with `get_full_scene_tree`
- **Dynamic Script Access**: Read and write any script by path with dynamic resource templates
- **Asset Management**: Query and organize project assets by type (images, audio, models, etc.)
- **Debug Output Access**: Retrieve runtime debug logs from the Godot editor
- **AI Script Generation**: Generate script templates from natural language descriptions
- **Node Transform Tools**: Easily update node position, rotation and scale

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waefrebeorn/Godot-MCP.git
cd Godot-MCP
```

### 2. Set Up the MCP Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run build
# Return to project root
cd ..
```

### 3. Set Up Coding Assistant

1. Add the following configuration (or use the included `mcp.json` as a reference):
   ```json
   // STDIO
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "godot-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT/server/dist/index.js"
         ],
         "env": {
           "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   // SSE: don't forget to build the server accordingly and start with `npm start`
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "godot-mcp": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8083/sse",
        "disabled": false,
        "alwaysAllow": []
      }
    }
  }
   ```
   > **Note**: Replace `PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT` with the absolute path to where you have this repository stored.

2. Restart the coding assistant

### 4. Open the Example Project in Godot

1. Open Godot Engine
2. Select "Import" and navigate to the cloned repository
3. Open the `project.godot` file
4. The MCP plugin is already enabled in this example project

## Using MCP

After setup, you can work with your Godot project directly from Claude using natural language. Here are some examples:

### Example Prompts

```
@mcp godot-mcp read godot://script/current

I need help optimizing my player movement code. Can you suggest improvements?
```

```
@mcp godot-mcp run get-full-scene-tree

Add a cube in the middle of the scene and then make a camera that is looking at the cube.
```

```
@mcp godot-mcp read godot://scene/current

Create an enemy AI that patrols between waypoints and attacks the player when in range.
```

### New Enhanced Commands Examples

```
@mcp godot-mcp read godot://script/res://scripts/player.gd

Please analyze this player script and suggest improvements.
```

```
@mcp godot-mcp run ai_generate_script --description "A health system with damage and healing" --node_type "Node"

Implement this health system in my game.
```

```
@mcp godot-mcp run list_assets_by_type --type images

Show me all the images in my project and help me organize them better.
```

### Natural Language Tasks Claude Can Perform

- "Create a main menu with play, options, and quit buttons"
- "Add collision detection to the player character"
- "Implement a day/night cycle system"
- "Refactor this code to use signals instead of direct references"
- "Debug why my player character falls through the floor sometimes"
- "Show me the full structure of my scene tree and explain the relationships"
- "Generate a script for enemy AI that follows the player"
